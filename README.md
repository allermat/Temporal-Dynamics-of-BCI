## Description
- Class bci contains the methods for fitting Bayesian Causal Inference models to behavioural and EEG data
- Class mvpa contains the methods for performing Support Vector Regression and related statistics on EEG data
- Class mvpares handles the mvpa result data and plotting as an mvpares object. 
- The rest of the functions are for running the behavioural analysis, preprocessing, mvpa, bci, TF-analysis, statistics and figure drawing, and some auxiliary functions.
